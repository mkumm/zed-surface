# Zed Extension for Surface

**Too early for actual use**

For the truly impatient, you can manually add a developer extension (like this one).

To install this as Developer Extension...
    1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
    2. From the Zed Extensions page, click "Install Dev Extension" button and select the directory of this extension.
    3. After about 30 seconds your extension should be ready to use.

To test, open/create any `.sface` file. This extension will only work on `.sface` files, not embedded Surface.

You can read more about [Developing Extensions for Zed](https://zed.dev/docs/extensions/developing-extensions).

You can read more about working with [Surface](https://hexdocs.pm/surface/Surface.html) and [Surface UI](https://surface-ui.org/getting_started).
